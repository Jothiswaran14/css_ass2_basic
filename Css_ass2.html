Engine
<p class="para2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Himalayan's engine was designed and produced by Royal Enfield from the ground-up 
    and shares little to no parts with other contemporaries in the company's line-up.
     The engine, named the LS410 indicating its long-stroke stroke ratio, is a unit-construction 411 cc 
     single-cylinder, oil-cooled 4-stroke SOHC engine. The motor generates a power output of 24.5 bhp at 6,500 rpm 
     (18.02 KW) and a maximum torque of 32 Nm at 4,000-4,500 rpm. The engine also includes an oil cooler, a first 
     among motorcycles manufactured by Royal Enfield India. The bike employs electronic fuel injection and the engine
      is mated to a 5-speed constant mesh transmission. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This engine has a single overhead camshaft, thereby moving away from the traditional push-rod design that had 
    been used by the company from 1955, starting with the original Bullet up to the contemporary Classic series.</p>
