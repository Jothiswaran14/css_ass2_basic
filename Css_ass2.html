<strong>Engine</strong>
<p class="para2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Himalayan's engine was designed and produced by Royal Enfield from the ground-up 
    and shares little to no parts with other contemporaries in the company's line-up.
     The engine, named the LS410 indicating its long-stroke stroke ratio, is a unit-construction 411 cc 
     single-cylinder, oil-cooled 4-stroke SOHC engine. The motor generates a power output of 24.5 bhp at 6,500 rpm 
     (18.02 KW) and a maximum torque of 32 Nm at 4,000-4,500 rpm. The engine also includes an oil cooler, a first 
     among motorcycles manufactured by Royal Enfield India. The bike employs electronic fuel injection and the engine
      is mated to a 5-speed constant mesh transmission. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This engine has a single overhead camshaft, thereby moving away from the traditional push-rod design that had 
    been used by the company from 1955, starting with the original Bullet up to the contemporary Classic series.</p>

    <p class="head">Royal Enfield Interceptor specification</p>
    <strong> Engine</strong>
    <p class="para2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Royal Enfield introduced their all new 736 cc twin cylinder engine in 1962 on the 750 Interceptor. 
        Bore and stroke was 71 mm × 93 mm (2.80 in × 3.66 in). The new engine was similar to the 692 cc engine; but 
        there was hardly any part that was not modified or improved. The engine cases were beefed up to withstand 
        the increased torque. What sets this engine apart from other contemporary British twins is that the crankshaft 
        was dynamically balanced from the factory which made these bikes one of the smoothest British twin engines ever.
         The Series 1 bikes had an automatic advance magneto and a new seat. There was a rare single carburettor model as
          well. It was manufactured until 1966.</p><br><br><br><br>
